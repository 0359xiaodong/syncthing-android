This app is currently in Alpha state, and you may experience bugs, performance problems or data loss.\n\n\
NOTE: At the moment, dynamic discovery does not work, you will have to hardcode all node IPs on at least one side.\n\n
There is currently no special handling for mobile data, so it may use up your data volume if active.\n\n\
Please report any problems you encounter.
